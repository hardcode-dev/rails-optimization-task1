  # Change this behavior by overriding either `DisabledByDefault` or `EnabledByDefault`.

  # cops in user configuration will be enabled even if they don't set the
  # Enabled parameter.
  # When `EnabledByDefault` is `true`, all cops, even those configured `Enabled: false`
  # in this file are enabled by default. Cops can still be disabled in user configuration.

  CacheRootDirectory: ~
  # It is possible for a malicious user to know the location of RuboCop's cache
  # directory by looking at CacheRootDirectory, and create a symlink in its
  # place that could cause RuboCop to overwrite unintended files, or read
  # malicious input. If you are certain that your cache location is secure from
  # this kind of attack, and wish to use a symlinked cache location, set this
  # value to "true".

  # What MRI version of the Ruby interpreter is the inspected code intended to
  # run on? (If there is more than one, set this to the lowest version.)
  # If a value is specified for TargetRubyVersion then it is used. Acceptable
  # values are specificed as a float (i.e. 2.5); the teeny version of Ruby
  # should not be included. If the project specifies a Ruby version in the
  # .ruby-version file, Gemfile or gems.rb file, RuboCop will try to determine
  # the desired version of Ruby by inspecting the .ruby-version file first,
  # followed by the Gemfile.lock or gems.locked file. (Although the Ruby version
  # is specified in the Gemfile or gems.rb file, RuboCop reads the final value
  # from the lock file.) If the Ruby version is still unresolved, RuboCop will
  # use the oldest officially supported Ruby version (currently Ruby 2.3).
